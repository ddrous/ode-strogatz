# Textbook Ordinary Differential Equations Benchmark 


This repository contains 2-state dynamic models adapted from Steven Strogatz's book "Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics". They represent idealized dynamical systems from many fields of study. 

Each system can exhibit chaotic and/or nonlinear behavior. For the purposes of modeling, these systems are simulated using initial conditions within stable basins of attraction. 

The systems are simulated using simulink and matlab. 

## Purpose

The data files from simulation are provided for benchmarking purposes for system identification / machine learning. The goal should be not only to produce an accurate dynamic model, but to produce a model that captures/matches the underlying processes used to generate the data.
